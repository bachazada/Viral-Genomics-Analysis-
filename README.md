This repository provides a set of R scripts to conduct various bioinformatics tasks related to viral genomics. It includes exercises such as:

Retrieving viral sequences from GenBank
Translating DNA sequences to protein sequences
Performing multiple sequence alignments
Constructing phylogenetic trees
Visualizing sequence alignments and phylogenetic relationships
These exercises are designed to help researchers analyze viral genomes and compare different coronaviruses. Specifically, the repository focuses on handling SARS-CoV-2 sequences and related viruses.
